            <h2>Client</h2>
            <p>Group activities such as the famous Trivial Pursuit and other games not requiring boards or cards are a
                very common way of spending quality time with close family and friends. These activities build rich
                traditions and valuable memories and stimulate our brains to cooperate and compete in a healthy way.
                However, they lack the ability to bring closer people who are physically far from each other.</p>
            <p>The concept behind our project is simple: we intend to develop a prototype capable of bridging this gap
                by allowing multiple players to interact with each other at a distance in the game that we intend to
                offer – the Charades.</p>
            <p>The rules of Charades are: one person must choose an idea to act out (this can be something like a book
                or a movie, or anything else); this person must then try to act out the idea for the group so that they
                successfully guess what the person was trying to act out; the person who gets it right first gets to
                have the next turn acting something out.</p>
            <p>To do this, we aim to provide an online system capable of streaming the individual acts of one player to
                all the others within a given session. But there is a twist. In order to “gamify” the concept, instead
                of simply streaming the live video captured by the players’ devices, we will stream a customizable
                avatar of themselves with the help of Orbbec (a Kinect-like device) that will replicate all the moves
                made by users. This way, players will not only be able to play with their dear friends but will also
                practice with other players while maintaining their anonymity. To further increase the protection of a
                player, the system allows the existence of a administrator agent, that is capable of receiving
                notification and monitor any live game session taking place. To notify the admin the user only has to
                raise of of their hands above their head. Additionally any player has the option of automatically
                closing the game session by crossing their arms above their head if they feel unconformable.</p>
            <p>Regarding the technical accomplishment of such vision, our plan is to develop a microservices solution
                based on
                Springboot, providing a web interface for users, persisting data in a PostgreSQL
                database and interacting with the client-side through a REST API. The data streams for game sessions
                will be dealt with Kafka. The system components shall be deployed in Docker containers and such
                deployment shall be automated with the help of Jenkins. During development, tests will be created in
                various levels to ensure the correct functioning of the entire system. Also, in all aspects of the
                project documentation will be a great concern, focusing mostly on the public API (with the use
                of Swagger) and on the code itself.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>In order to make a solid representation of our target audience and the goals the system should achieve,
                we resorted to the method of personas. A
                persona is a fictitious person that serves as an archetypical user of a system, an example of the kind
                of person who would interact with it. In our case, we created three complementary personas to more
                closely define our target audience. These are presented next.</p><br>

        <div id="manual" style="padding-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Manual</h2>
            <p>This manual is mainly intended for the system's end-user. A detailed description of how to download,
                install and make the first steps on our Charades platform.</p>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>Installing Stickman Charade’s desktop application is a very straightforward process, you only need to
                have at least 50Mb of free disk space, access to the Internet and a web browser such as Brave installed.
                Following is a step-by-step guide to install the application on Windows (although it has an equivalent
                process for the Linux OS).</p>
            <h4>Step 1: Register in our Platform</h4>
            <p>Go to <a href="/register" style="color: aquamarine;">here</a> and fill the form to register in our
                platform. After that you should be redirected to the usr page and the Desktop app download should be
                enabled.</p>
            <h4>Step 2: Download the Desktop app</h4>
            <p>Choose the version you wish to download for your Operating System and click on the highlighted text.
                A pop-up window should appear, choose “Save File” and, if available, choose the destination folder.
                Wait for the download to be completed and locate the .zip file.</p>
            <img style="width: 75%;" src="assets/img/documentation/downloadPopup.png" alt="Download Popup" />
            <h4>Step 3: Decompress and Run the application</h4>
            <p>After downloading the .zip file containing a version of the desktop application, decompress it and open
                the directory generated.
                All of the dependencies are included in this folder, as well as the binaries of Stickman Charades, so
                you can simply run the executable file “StickmanCharades.exe” and enjoy the game.</p>
            <img style="width: 75%;" src="assets/img/documentation/decompression.png" alt="Decompression Folder" />

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Creation of Game Sessions</h3>
            <p>Once you have installed Stickman Charades’ desktop application and started it, you will be asked to sign
                in with the credentials created on registration.
                After that, you will be presented with the main menu.</p>
            <img style="width: 75%;" src="assets/img/documentation/desktopLogin.png" alt="Desktop Login Page" />
            <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;">Menu Organization</h4>
            <p>The main menu contains 4 buttons: Create Session, Join Session, Options and Quit.
                The Quit button, as the name suggests, exits the application.
                The Options button is meant to tweak the interface and personalize the game.
                The Join Session will redirect you to a menu containing all of the currently open sessions so that you
                can request to join one of them.
                The Create Session opens the session creation menu.</p>
            <img style="width: 75%;" src="assets/img/documentation/desktopMenu.png" alt="Desktop Menu Page" />
            <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;">Creating a Game Session</h4>
            <p>When creating a game session, you can define its name, duration (in minutes) and maximum number of
                players.
                You can also define the words which will have to be discovered by other players based on the movements
                and poses that the actor (the player chosen to act in front of the depth camera) executes.
                Additionally, you can choose amongst a list of avatars which you wish to represent you during the game.
                This is meant to conceal the identity of players while still allowing to differentiate each other.</p>
            <img style="width: 75%;" src="assets/img/documentation/desktopNewSession.png"
                alt="New Session Desktop Page" />
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">Once you have made your choices, you can proceed to open the session. Only then
                will the session be
                available for other players to enter and participate.
                Once the maximum number of players is reached or you are satisfied with those that have already joined,
                you can proceed to start the session.
                At this stage the time counter begins and all players can start executing their roles.
                Have fun!</p>
            <h4>Gameplay Commands</h4>
            <p>As an actor during a game session, you have a few gesture commands available with specific purposes.
                These are mostly for managing sessions and not so much for the gameplay itself.
                For example, by raising your hands above your head, you notify our administrators that something is
                wrong and should be addressed by an impartial entity (e.g. hacking, bugs, etc.). You cna also cross you
                arms above your head to immediately close the game session if you feel unconformable or you think
                something is not right, even if you are not the game session creator.</p>

        <div id="specification" style="padding-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Specification</h2>
            <h2>Usage Scenarios</h2>
            <p class="mb-20">With the personas defined, we can proceed to studying the most probable and appropriate use
                cases. At this stage, the scenarios have a high-level nature and are open to updates. The personas are
                here used to easily present these usage scenarios:</p>

            <h2>Solution Requirements</h2>
            <div id="scenario">
                <b>Project Specific</b><br>
                Scenario 1 – Game Session Start
                <p>Jack starts a game with the Millers already inside a session and the actual game is initialized with
                    the defined configurations and the chosen avatars.</p>
                Scenario 2 – In-Game Acting
                <p>The Millers take turns being the actors that perform based on the charades they are given
                    (automatically assigned).</p>
                Scenario 3 – In-Game Answering
                <p>Peter is playing in a session and watching another participant perform a charade. He thinks he knows
                    the answer, so he types it and submits. All participants are notified if the answer is correct,
                    which ends the turn of the actor and awards a point to Peter, or if it is incorrect, in which case
                    the turn keeps going and Peter may try another guess if the rules of the game session allow it.</p>
                Scenario 4 – In-Game Commands
                <p>The current actor performs a specific movement that is interpreted by the platform and pauses the
                    game.</p>
                Scenario 5 – Spectator Mode
                <p>Frances is tired of playing, but still wants to be in the game session and interact with her family,
                    so she decides to change her status from player to spectator, so she can watch her family play and
                    still have fun by spending time with them.</p>
                Scenario 6 – Exiting Session
                <p>Peter plays for a while in an open session but decides to search for a more crowded one, so he exits
                    the current session he is in and goes back to the list of open sessions.</p>
                Scenario 7 – Automatic Ending Session
                <p>The system ends the session according to the rules (e.g. all rounds have been completed) and presents
                    the results to all session players, as well as the winner.</p>
                Scenario 8 – Ending Session
                <p>It’s late, so Jack and his family decide to stop playing, and Jack ends the game session they are in.
                    With that, the session results and the winner are shown to all player.</p>
                Scenario 9 – Closing Session
                <p>Jack closes (deletes) session and all players are duly notified.</p>

                <b>Generic</b><br>
                Scenario 1 – Registration
                <p>Jack creates an account for him, his wife and his mother-in-law so that they can play together.</p>
                Scenario 2 – Authentication
                <p>Frances logs in with her credentials so that Jack can identify her when creating a session.</p>
                Scenario 3 – Private Session Creation
                <p>Jack creates a game session open only to players invited by him.</p>
                Scenario 4 – Session Configuration
                <p>Jack decides the rules of the session (such as how the actors are chosen, how many points are needed
                    for a player to win, how many rounds, etc.) through the configuration panel.</p>
                Scenario 5 – Session Invitation
                <p>Jack invites his wife, her siblings and his mother-in-law through their usernames.</p>
                Scenario 6 – Invitation Acceptance
                <p>Frances accepts the invitation received by Jack and joins the session created by him.</p>
                Scenario 7 – Public Session Creation
                <p>Peter creates a game session open to anyone.</p>
                Scenario 8 – Public Session Listing
                <p>Jack checks the list of currently open sessions (created by friends or anonymous users) so that he
                    can practice before playing with his mother-in-law.</p>
                Scenario 9 – Public Session Entrance
                <p>Jack enters Peter’s game session and waits for the game to start.</p>
                Scenario 10 – Avatar Choice
                <p>Peter customizes an avatar that will represent him in game sessions, choosing between options such as
                    color of the avatar (and perhaps height or event 3D model).</p>

            <h2>Main Features</h2>
            <p class="mb-20">Finally, we have everything we need to define the main features to be developed. The most
                important features that are paramount for the success of this project are listed below:</p>

            <div class="">
                <ul class="unordered-list">
                    <li><b>Charade Session:</b> the core of the project, a Charade Session is a room in which people
                        take turns being actors (the ones who receive a theme and must perform to the camera in order to
                        give hints to the charade solution) and participants (the ones who take guesses while watching a
                        video of an avatar mimicking the current actor’s movements);
                        <ul style="padding-top: 5px">
                            <li><b>Private Session:</b> a session can be private, as in only friends or people invited
                                by the host player can participate or watch;</li>
                            <li><b>Public Session:</b> a session can be public, in which anyone can request to enter the
                                session and play or watch others play (as spectators), so it doesn’t need invitation nor
                                do the players need to be friends.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Avatar Creation:</b> for anonymity, shyness, or just to have fun, all players have Avatars
                        (models that can be customized and are shown to others when a player is acting a charade) and
                        have a menu where they can create or customize them;</li>
                    <li><b>Seamless Interaction:</b> players can play a game of charade and interact with each other
                        when in a session, having an Avatar representing them with a fast transmission and reliable GUI
                        that is easy to learn and use;</li>
                    <li><b>Streaming of Avatar:</b> in a Charade Session, all movements done in front of the camera are
                        captured by it and replicated by the server in a video, represented by the actor’s Avatar, that
                        it streams to all participants in the session so they can watch the movements and take their
                        guesses;</li>
                    <li><b>Hosting of Sessions:</b> any user can host a session of the game and decide the ruleset, if
                        the session is Private or Public, and choose to invite friends. The host can decide when the
                        game ends, and even remove players from the session if needed;</li>
                    <li><b>List of Sessions:</b> all users will have access to a list that shows all public sessions
                        that they can join, and even private sessions from their friends and family, to which they can
                        request entry and await acceptance by the host of the private session.</li>
                </ul>

                &emsp;As an authenticated user joining a game session<br>&emsp;I want the camera to work to be able to
                perform the initial position<br>&emsp;So that the platform recognizes me and the game session can
                start.<br>

                <p>Group's internal establishment of the project objective, goals, personas and main features.
                    Definition of a desktop and a web UI. Definition of Jakarta as the server technology and Postgres
                    for the necessary database. Usage of Apache Kafka for the message bus.
                    Production of a formal document containing all those choices. </p>
                <p>Initial investigations and test over our sensor, the Orbbec motion camera. Tests of possible
                    technologies for the data collector. Construction of a initial project skeleton and validation of
                    chosen technologies.</p>
                <p>Architectural discussions and decision of the positioning and integration options of the system's
                    components, such as rendering engine. Tests of the functionalities of Unity's Orbbec SDK and
                    possible limitations.</p>
                <p>Reached conclusion that a rendering engine was not necessary since Unity could be used since no
                    relevant limitations were found in the Orbbec's SDK. Definition of the system's public REST API and
                    provided functions. Development of necessary code to capture user's skeleton and creation of the
                    desktop app main menu. Integration of Jakarta with the PostgreSQL after several integration
                    problems.Creation of some database data models. Initial steps in the browser portal by creating a
                    simple documentation page. </p>
                <p>Evolution in the operational front; dockerization of the server application and deployment in the
                    runtime virtual machine provided. Further developments in the Jakarta application by integrating
                    with Websockets and Kafka after many integration problems.</p>
                <p>After many integration problems and lack of documentation from the Jakarta framework, the team
                    decided to migrate to Springboot, which by experience the group known to have better documentation
                    and integrations with other technologies were much easier. Total Jakarta to Springboot migration,
                    implementation of the necessary facilities to support tests and security in the REST public API.
                    Evolution in Jenkins, the technology used to achieve CI/CD; development of pipelines with support
                    for tests, binary publishing and automatic deploy. Implementation of Kafka producers and consumer in
                    the Unity app. Creation of the mapping between collected skeletons and 3D models. Configuration of
                    Unity app build process.</p>
                <p>Decrease of the team size due to the difficulties experienced by a element. The decision was
                    triggered by the element but both the remaining team and team advisor were in the loop. Setup of a
                    basic demo. Group discussion of the human gesture based events present in the system and the
                    processing necessary for each one. Revision and update of the formal documentation files.</p>
                <p>Discussion of problems related to GUI access in the testing phase.Tests of WebGl Unity deployment
                    deployed by that discussion. Definition and implementation of all necessary test for all Cucumber
                    specified scenarios, specially the ones based in events an that use Kafka(usage of an external Kafka
                    container). Correction of the jenkins pipeline to
                    support binary storage in a artifactory and redirecting of deployment directives to the correct
                    machine.</p>
                <p>Decision that if necessary, the GUI test would be made only over the Web-based portal. Conclusion
                    after a discussion with the project advisor that there would not be necessary to test
                    GUIs.Development of the game session engine. Update of Unity's building configurations to also
                    consider
                    Linux OS. Division of the prior main pipeline to different ones, each with its specific objective.
